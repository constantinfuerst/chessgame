# chessgame with sfml and ascii renderer
Chessgame project I made to learn OOP, using sfml combined with tgui or a console as output.
Supports unlimited savegames to file, undo/redo actions and reset - these are only available with the SFML rendered version, utilizing the consoleASCII renderer does not allow any of the above.
